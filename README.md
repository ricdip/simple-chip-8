# simple-chip-8

A simple CHIP-8 emulator written in C++ for fun and training.


## Structure

- **emulation**: files that contain all the logic of the emulator

- **graphics**: files that contain the graphical part of the emulator

- **roms**: CHIP-8 ROM files that I found [here](https://github.com/loktar00/chip8)

- **main.cpp**: main file of the emulator


## Dependencies

- This emulator uses the [SDL library](https://www.libsdl.org/).
